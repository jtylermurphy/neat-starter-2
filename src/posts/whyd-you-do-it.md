Why'd you buy a 100-year-old mansion on Capitol Avenue? Don't you know old houses bring old problems?


Ahh, why DID we do it? Great question, and one we receive quite a bit. There are several reasons why my good friend (Kevin Callaway) and I jumped in with both feet. Here are a few reasons that come to  mind:



\#1. A property like this doesn't show up every day, and we have a vision of what it can be.



\#2. We believe in Jefferson City and her historical corridor stretching from the Missouri Capitol to the old State Prison. Little did we know how deep and rich the 'historical' part was (more on the history later).



\#3. We want to create some cool stuff. We've long believed in the redevelopment of Jefferson City and the old prison site, here's our chance to get involved.



\#4. The greatest reason is friendship. Our wives agreed we could go build something, and it's been fun building something together!



We've been working at the property at 624 E. Capitol Avenue and 622 E. Capitol Avenue for the past nine months. Specifically, we have been working on The Carriage House heavily over the past four months. Much of it has been recorded, and we discover new items every day.



We look forward to sharing this with you. We will start posting information on the blog as well as other social media platforms. Enjoy!
